# Standards are Public Goods.

### Standards are Public Goods, we say. But why is that? 

### What standards are, why do we need them, who will build, and who will use standards? 

*Let's dive in!* 🚀

So basically, we're trying to create a framework to coordinate standards as Public Goods, so that's what the mission is like: standards should be Public Goods. But they are not Public Goods today.

And there's a big business all around the world about standards. Companies like ISO or many institutions worldwide make a lot of money just being in the middle, the men in the middle when it comes to standards. And that's wrong because basically, the standard is just a way for two organizations to cooperate. It's interoperability between entities, whatever it is.

Another thing: Experts build today's standards. 

*When we say experts - we mean corporations.* 💼

The way we name things so that we can cooperate, such as language, is a standard. If we don't have language, we can't cooperate, and we don't have a standard.

And business, they need the standards. Imagine that two companies want to buy one from each other. So they need a standard paper where they say: 

- This is the number of things I want to buy.

- Here is the price and tax.

- Here is the address. 

So that's a standard. 

An invoice is some standard so companies can talk to each other. 

And the only way we can have standards today is by going to standardization bodies, international bodies, where any standard takes one to five years to build, and guess who is building it - experts.

So basically, it costs a lot of money and time. 💰 🕞

A business that needs a standard pays a lot of money to people who can build but don't need the standard. Standardization bodies are hired to create a standard but not to use it.

And this means that basically for them, a standard it's a whitepaper of 300 pages that nobody understands, and it's normal because then everybody needs to hire them to understand that standard, and that's once again a big business.

All big corporations like Microsoft or Google are just part of this standardization body because they want to control the standard.

That's a big business.

### Then comes Web3.

And in Web3, we also need the standards, a lot of them. 
But the speed is entirely different, and the standards we need are also different. 

How to bring a sword from one game to another?
Or take a car from one game to another. 
And it's still a car there. 
It could work in games or other areas, like art, music, etc.

So standards are huge. 🌍

And if we do standards, not by experts but by doers, and we move the lifecycle of the standard from three years to two weeks, then we can have real interoperability in Web3  that we don't have right now.

Every time we speak to other protocols, they have a problem because there are five protocols, and all of them are naming things differently, and there's no way they can just put it together.

### So this coordination is where we go in. 

We will offer a way where coders, people who are building something, go to this Wikipedia for standards (Unite DAO) because we want to have them in the same place. I look for the standard, and if it's there, I can use it. If not - I can build it within the Unite DAO or look for someone in the Unite DAO community who would build the standard. 

A standard can be almost anything and used not just by coders. So finally, the ones who are using the standard are bloggers, artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, DeFi, Metaverse, Gaming, NFTs, and many more. Standards can be used for anything because the standard is just a way of naming things that we both agree on and understand.

We can build standards fast, standards that builders make. Builders can be coders, artists, musicians, or anybody who needs a standard and want to use it. Builders can segment into working groups and verticals. Then you can have a working group for NFT, Metaverse, Music, Security, DeFi, Gaming, Art, and many more. There can be a lot of working groups, and they can grow organically — this way, you can scale standards, and no one controls them. 

There are some standards that you need to pay if you want to use them. And we think it's wrong. Standards really should be Public Goods and open-source so everybody can use them.
