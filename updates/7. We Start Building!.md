"Is this project dead?" We sometimes get questions like this. And like many other great projects that are building something, we face challenges along the way. But let's start from the beginning of this month and what happened, why we have been so silent recently. 

As you probably know - our Roadmap says everything - the first two phases are crucial for the project to survive and keep building. And that is why we decided on our first try to go and ask for funding at WEB3 Foundation. The answer was no. 

Our second option and choice were Arweave. And the only thing we regret is that Arweave did not become our number one go-to protocol for help. Our vision and Arweave enthusiasm towards Unite DAO project became a perfect storm - we decided to build on Arweave!

It took us a few weeks to understand what and where we wanted to build after our first unsuccessful attempt to raise funds for the project. 
With these challenges behind us, now we can focus on building, finally!

Arweave is great for the support they give us and the mentorship and clear path they offer for new projects like Unite DAO.

We have applied for the Arweave Build - It's a very clear 5 step program where you have to build first to prove your worth. This concept works best for us - build first. 

We promise to update you along the way; every step we take - we'll document. 

Thanks, everyone, for your patience, understanding, and support. If we are silent in the future, please know that most likely, we are building something great or tackling another challenge along the way!

You can always pop into our Discord server to learn more about us. 

Stay awesome!
Unite DAO team
